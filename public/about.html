        <h2> About Me </h2>
            <h3> Hi! My name is Mattie Britt and I am 20 years old.
                I have high expecations for myself and large aspirations I want to reach.
                I have a drive to prove what I'm made of and change the world along the way! 
                I'm currently aspiring to be a very successful entrepeneur and I'm on my way to achieving that goal.
                I'll always be happy to help those in need and I hope one day someone may be able to come up to me on the street and I can leave a lasting impact on them.
            </h3>

        <h2> Goals </h2>
            <h3> I have many goals but my primary goal in life, at this point in time, is to become a professional web developer.
                 Afterwards, I have a goal of making my first $10,000 a month at some point in the future (I will define that specific point in time soon).
                 Generally, all I want from my life is to be successful and make a large lasting impact on the world around me. 
                 I have a vision of living a busy, but happy and fulfilled, life out with my girlfriend, and future fiance, Morgan.
            </h3>
